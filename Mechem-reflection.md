#Ed's reflections

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Not too many, really.


**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Helin (the Guide) clarified how Fetch & Merge can be used, instead of Pull.


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Many. I asked half the questions, actually ;)  Can't remember the specifics. Little procedural details, clarifying & double-checking what my pair and I already were pretty sure.


**What still confuses you about Git?**

Not much.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Good :)  I felt we collaborated well.
