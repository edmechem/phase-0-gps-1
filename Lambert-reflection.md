**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
The hardest thing for me to get was figuring out git workflow

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
My partner helped me with short cut commands and remembering the steps to getting everything commited and pushed. Helin really helped clarifying the fetch command and how it worked kind of like a pull.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
There were a lot of questions asked. I think thats the best way to learn.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I think everything was pretty clarified.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I think we did really well. It was a good collaboration on both our parts.
